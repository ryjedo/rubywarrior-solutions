==============================

My solutions to the rubywarrior gem puzzles.


I'm not particularly thrilled with the solution to level9. ultimately the quick and dirty was to simply turn to face left at the beginning of the level. This works, but if for some reason an archer was spawned in front of, instead of behind, it would no longer work. unfortunately there is no way that i could find to detect the type of enemy (archer, wizard, sludge) so it seems like a "general case" solution is beyond the scope of the rubywarrior gem framework.
